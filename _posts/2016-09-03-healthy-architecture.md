HEALTHY ARCHITECTURE

_Designing Healthy Architecture for Increased Wellbeing_

We all know that nature is the main inspiration for beauty and harmony. **Nature creates spectacular designs**, some elegantly simple and others surprisingly complex, but **all are beneficial to life**.

What if we could access these hidden natural design principles when building our homes to **greatly improve wellbeing**?

Meet Marvin. Marvin plans to build a new home. He and his family enjoy a healthy lifestyle, and especially enjoy relaxing outdoors. Being in the natural environment always has a calming and harmonising effect on the entire family, and Marvin wants to achieve exactly the same balanced energy for their new home!

He searches the Internet for ideas, and although there are many websites offering advice, he feels they only touch the surface of what he is really looking for and none offer turnkey solutions.

By chance, he meets an old school friend during a business trip. After hearing of Marvin's concerns his friend recommends that he contact **GeoDesign, a firm specialising in the use of scientifically designed shapes, proportions, angles, numbers and colours to introduce natural subtle energy harmonisation into architecture**. GeoDesign works closely with architects to create harmony between human habitation and nature to ensure that buildings, furnishings and surroundings become part of a unified natural composition.

In conjunction with the architect, GeoDesign can either design a house or commercial building from the very beginning or adjust existing architectural plans for increased beneficial harmony.

Marvin was delighted that his own design ideas could be so easily integrated and adjusted. Finally, he and his family had **a place they could truly call 'Home.'**
