  'Listening to the silences', an Internet book, is a valuable reference for
  anyone seeking new approaches to mental health, psychiatric nursing and
  psychiatric treatment. It is based on experiences of hearing voices and
  reveals how hypnosis, hypnotherapy, channelling, Reiki, using cannabis,
  mescaline and other recreational drugs, also many mind-opening practices
  associated with deep meditation and mind control, can lead to spiritual
  intrusion and mental harm for vulnerable people.
